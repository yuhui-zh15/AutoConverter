## üîÆ Abstract

The rapid development of vision language models (VLMs) demands rigorous and reliable evaluation. However, current visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks often depend on open-ended questions, making accurate evaluation difficult due to the variability in natural language responses. To address this, we introduce AutoConverter, an agentic framework that automatically converts these open-ended questions into multiple-choice format, enabling objective evaluation while reducing the costly question creation process. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoConverter can generate correct and challenging multiple-choice questions, with VLMs demonstrating consistently similar or lower accuracy on these questions compared to human-created ones. Using AutoConverter, we construct VMCBench, a benchmark created by transforming 20 existing VQA datasets into a unified multiple-choice format, totaling 9,018 questions. We comprehensively evaluate 28 state-of-the-art VLMs on VMCBench, setting a new standard for scalable, consistent, and reproducible VLM evaluation.

**Overview.** *(Left)* We analyze existing open-ended VQA evaluation metrics, underscoring their limitations in providing accurate and reproducible assessments. *(Middle)* We introduce AutoConverter, a multi-agent system that automatically converts open-ended questions into multiple-choice format, enabling objective assessment while reducing the costly question creation process. *(Right)* Using AutoConverter, we convert and refine 20 existing VQA datasets into a unified multiple-choice benchmark to support future VLM research.
